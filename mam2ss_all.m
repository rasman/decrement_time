% returns a state space model from vectors of clearance
% and compartment volumes. All states are drug amount
% in the compartment; to get concentration, divide by compartment
% volume in the C matrix. Note that this code can handle an
% arbitrary number of compartments, but assumes the first compartment is
% the central compartment (mam is short for mamillary).
% The effect site compartment is represented as a compartment of negligible
% volume adjoined to the central compartment.
